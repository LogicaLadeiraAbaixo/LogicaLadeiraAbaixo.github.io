We are a group of professors, colleagues, researchers, and students with common
interests in Logic, Metaphysics, and Formal Philosophy. The group is hosted at
the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP), but it also counts with researchers
from serveral different universities. We have a weekly based schedule, and our
activities include both reading sessions and invited speakers. Some of our
meetings have been recorded and are available on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQg-1jmAK7MLHJitNd75tQ).
