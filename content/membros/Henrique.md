I received my PhD degree in Philosophy at the University of Campinas in 2019
under the supervision of Professor Walter Carnielli. I am currently an adjunct
professor at the Federal University of Maranh√£o, a postdoctoral researcher at
the Federal University of Minas Gerais, and a full member of the Advanced
Reasoning Forum. My main research areas are: mathematical logic, non-classical
logics, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of mathematics.
